[Ready for Implementation]
All planning documents completed and verified against:
- Hardware capabilities
- Software dependencies
- Pipeline continuity

Next Phase: Begin actual installations and tool configuration per:
- InstallPlan.txt (Python/Blender setup)
- ModelsPlan.txt (model downloads)
- ToolsPlan.txt (Meshlab/Blender workflows)

[Active Implementation Pathways]

   - Python 3.10.9 → C:\Python310
   - Blender 3.6 LTS → Default install path
   - Meshlab 2022.12 → Portable version in tools/

2. Model Acquisition: Execute ModelsPlan.txt
   - Clone Stable Point-E: git clone https://github.com/openai/point-e
   - GET3D: Download pretrained weights from NVIDIA NGC

3. Pipeline Activation: Follow ToolsPlan.txt
   - Configure Meshlab batch processing
   - Establish Blender scripting environment
