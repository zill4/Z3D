## 🌟 Current Capabilities
- [x] Environment validation system
- [x] Text-to-mesh generation
- [ ]Texture generation (upscaled) -> Need to fix the upscaling loop.
- [ ] Automatic character rigging
- [ ] Motion template integration
- [ ] UE5/Unity export pipeline

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required Software
follow steps in plan using conda install
may need to manually install all the other bs

### System Requirements
- Windows 10/11
- NVIDIA GPU (RTX 2070+ recommended)
- CUDA Toolkit 11.8
- 16GB+ RAM recommended

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install prerequisites listed above
2. Clone repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/zill4/z3d-pipeline
cd z3d-pipeline
```

## 🛠️ Validation Suite
```powershell
# Run comprehensive system check
.\Validate-3DWorkflow.ps1 -Verbose

# Successful output shows:
[PASS] Core dependencies verified
[PASS] Repository structure valid  
[PASS] Basic generation successful
```

## 🚨 Common Solutions
| Issue                  | Resolution                         |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| CUDA_PATH not found    | Re-run setup script                |
| Python import errors   | Verify virtual environment         |
| Partial generations    | Check VRAM allocation (>10GB free)|

## 📅 Roadmap
